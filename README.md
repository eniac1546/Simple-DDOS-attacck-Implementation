DDoS Attack Implementation
Title
Developing a DDOS Attack with HTTP and TCP SYN Traffic Utilizing Socket Programming and Scapy
Abstract
This project developed a Python program using the Scapy library to simulate DDoS attacks in a secure, controlled environment. The aim was to understand DDoS tactics without affecting actual services or infrastructure. Users can replicate different DDoS methods like overwhelming connection attempts and traffic flooding. The simulations used fake network packets from random sources to resemble widespread attacks and were carried out on a closed network to avoid real-world impact. Wireshark was also employed to analyze traffic and understand the response of TCP and HTTP protocols during such attacks.

Step-by-Step Guide: DDoS Attack Simulation
Environment Setup
1. Python Installation
•	Visit the official Python website and download the appropriate version for your operating system.
•	During installation on Windows, ensure to select the "Add Python to PATH" option.
•	Verify installation by typing Python --version or python3 --version in the command prompt or terminal.
2. Scapy Installation
•	Ensure Python is installed and added to the system's PATH.
•	Open a command prompt or terminal window.
•	Install Scapy using pip: pip install scapy.
•	Validate the installation by typing Scapy --version.
3. Sublime Text Editor Installation
•	Download Sublime Text IDE from the official website.
•	Run the installer and follow the installation wizard.
•	Launch Sublime Text from the Start Menu or search bar.
4. Wireshark Installation
•	Download Wireshark from its official website, selecting the version suitable for your operating system.
•	Execute the installer and follow the prompts of the installation wizard.
•	Install packet capture libraries like WinPcap or Npcap if prompted.
•	Launch Wireshark from the Start Menu.
Implementation
1. Server and Client Setup
•	Use main_server.py to establish a virtual server.
•	Use main.py to test the connection between the client and the socket server.
2. TCP SYN Flood Attack
•	Implement tcp_syn_flood_attack.py using Scapy.
•	Target the loopback address (127.0.0.1) and a specific port (e.g., 33547).
•	The script should simulate a SYN flood attack with randomized IP addresses.
3. HTTP Flood Attack
•	Develop http_flood_attack.py using multithreading to simulate concurrent connections.
•	Target the same loopback address and port.
•	Use Scapy to create random paths for the fake packets.
4. Monitoring and Analysis with Wireshark
•	Use Wireshark to monitor and analyze the traffic generated by both the TCP SYN flood and HTTP flood attacks.
•	Observe the packets' origins, protocols, and behavior.
Conclusion
Upon successful execution of the above steps, the DDoS attack simulation will be complete. This project should be conducted in a controlled environment for educational purposes only.
Results
Successful execution of main_server.py and main.py established a socket connection. Wireshark's analysis provided insights into the TCP SYN flood and HTTP flood attacks, showcasing packets from random sources and protocols.



Conclusion
The project successfully simulated DDoS attacks, offering practical learning in cybersecurity. It underscored the importance of ethical conduct in research and the value of hands-on learning in this field.
